                                The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce using a 
                                very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to 
                                light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, 
                                eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used 
                                a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces
                                thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.

                                Nicephore Niepce (born Joseph Niepce; 7 March 1765 – 5 July 1833) was a French inventor, 
                                now usually credited as the inventor of photography and a pioneer in that field.
                                Niepce developed heliography, a technique he used to create the world's oldest surviving 
                                product of a photographic process: a print made from a photoengraved printing plate in 1825.
                                In 1826 or 1827, he used a primitive camera to produce the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene.

                                An 1877 color photo by Louis Ducos du Hauron, a French pioneer of color photography. 
                                The overlapping subtractive yellow, cyan and red (magenta) image elements can be seen 
                                clearly along the edges of the image.<br>
                                Subtractive Color: A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, 
                                inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result 
                                of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others. 
                                The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and 
                                therefore remain visible.
